Description: DCC IO Daemon - RESTful API for DCC command stations
 A standalone Java daemon that provides a simple, clean API for controlling
 DCC command stations by leveraging JMRI's rich controller support without
 the complexity of JMRI's full object model and data structures.
 .
 Features:
  - Auto-discovery of USB/serial controllers
  - RESTful JSON API
  - WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Web-based configuration interface
  - Multi-controller support with role assignment
 .
 Requires JMRI to be installed separately using the jmri-install script.
